  # Because I always forget:
  #
  # Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
  #   MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  #   MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  #   PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
  #   Refer to: http://semver.org/
  VERSION = "0.7.0"
